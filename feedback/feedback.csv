It is very, very refreshing to find people willing to teach, that have passion and insight into their fields, and exercise both expertise, relatability and patience. 

Thanks!

How about a course on big ""geodata"" ???",,,,"Databases (pandas, sqlalchemy), More Mapping (cartopy, kartograph), Cat Pictures"

- The topics of the course seemed very useful.  
- Some knowledge of programming was assumed, but not too much.  As a result, we didn't spend time writing a ""Hello world"" program and a program to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  Also, we learned about object types, Python notation, etc. by doing rather than by being told and expected to remember.  ","Overall, I think the course was great.  My only comment is that I think some of the stuff we've learned in the 2nd and 3rd weeks, such as the structure of scripts and functions, should have been introduced in the first week.

There was also a variety of different tools and applications, from data viz to data scraping, so that people from different fields and with various skill-levels could approach data analysis.",I suggest break-out sections for students to work on coding together. Maybe discuss or demo a tool/topic for the first-half. Then students can break out into different tables and work on the assignment/own programs/ applications using the tool. ,,"Many thanks for offering this course! I felt greater confidence about Python and coding after this course. After exposure to all the new libraries and packages, I am inspired with all the new methods of data analysis.
