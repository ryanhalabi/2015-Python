'''
We'd like to do network analysis on a body of text.

Build a graph where the nodes are names, and an edge exists if the two
names appear in the same sentence.

The first rule about regular expressions:
    Avoid them when possible!!!!

Data Golf!
Today it's for a prize- a book on Python
Hints:
    - An ASCII character of text is 1 byte
    - A typical word is 6 characters
    - A typical novel has 200K words
    - War and Peace is 3x a normal book

How big is War and Peace?

regex should match capital letters not at the beginning of a sentence.
